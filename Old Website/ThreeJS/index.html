        I'm a 20-year-old who is passionate about technology and digital
        art/design. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at
        Ryerson University. I've made it a goal for myself to continually learn
        new technologies. On my free time, I like to practice digital art
        including Digital Drawing, Painting, 2D Animation, and 3D Animation. I'm
        the creator of an animation business called RMAnimations (Short for Raj
        Mistry Animations), and over the years I've had the opportunity to work
        with many creative individuals including some well-known YouTubers. This
        website was created to demonstrate my abilities as both a digital artist
        and software developer by showcasing some of my projects.
